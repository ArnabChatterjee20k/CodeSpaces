2. My orchastrator will sit in between all of tehm
3. it will scale up and down asgs as per the users
4. now the best feature would be if an instance is having some low usage liek 50% then it will redirect user to the same instance and create andother docker container inside and user will be able to use that
inactive for 15mins , scale down that inactive machine
